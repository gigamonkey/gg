Some ideas of things to do next:

- Implement positioners, especially for stacked and side-by-side bar charts.

- Legends

- Facets.

- Size scales for more geometries.

- Coordinate systems (esp. pie charts)

- Regularize/rationalize/document use of CSS for controlling appearence.


- In-browser interactive graph builder. (REPL?)
