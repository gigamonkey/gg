See a demo here:

Some ideas of things to do next:

- Implement positioners, especially for stacked and side-by-side bar charts.

- Facets.

- Size scales for more geometries.

- Coordinate systems (esp. pie charts)

- Regularize/rationalize/document use of CSS for controlling appearence.

- In-browser interactive graphic builder. (REPL?)
