* Some notes if you want to hack on this and submit pull requests:

If you use Emacs, please set indent-tab-modes to nil and run M-x
whitespace-cleanup on files before submitting pull requests. (If you
want to be hardcore, add whitespace-cleanup to before-save-hook to do
it all the time.) If you don't use Emacs, please do your best to
remove trailing spaces from lines. This reduces the number of lines of
diff output we need to look at be removing all changes due to
unimportant (and invisible) changes in spacing.
